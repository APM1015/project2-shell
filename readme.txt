The shell lab was pretty difficult for me. I originally implemented the built in functions and found those to be easy. I then started working on
my redirection functions and after a lot of reading I implemented them using dup2(). I then went straight to the piping process, and actually got a 
solid understanding of it. I found a lot of good readings and videos on the topic in addition the the useful pseudocode provided in the lab manuel. I spent a lot of time on this topic and originally implemented a regular piping function. Then made my way to the for loop with the recommended array. I handled
the three cases of the two edges and the middle pipes. The array with the for loop was really confusing me as I originally was doing "fd[]" for the pipe values but eventually figured out how to implement the pipes with an array. From here I ran into a lot of difficulty. I had skipped over the PATH parsing section and spent many hours trying to figure it out. I was able to get it to work using strtok, execv, PATH, and I had to implement the access() function as I was running into many errors. Unfourtunately, I could only get this to work for the ls command, and the wc command was not working. I then implemented a while loop while to parse the imput and call my other functions. This while loop was able to work correctly for my built ins, but I was having trouble having it work with the testing for my redirection and piping functions.
